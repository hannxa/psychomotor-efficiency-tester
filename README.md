The aim of the project was to create a time-dependent application, one of whose main tasks is to measure and track time as precisely as possible, as well as to visualize the obtained results. 
The application is intended to function as a psychomotor skills tester, designed, for example, for driver candidates. The application consists of three main modules:

➢ User Interface Module: Responsible for displaying instructions, information about remaining attempts, and presenting results (both numerical and graphical). It enables interaction with the user and provides a clear presentation of data.

➢ Test Logic Module: Generates random time intervals and decides whether the user will perform a visual or auditory test. It collects data on the user's reaction time and ensures precise measurement.

➢ Results Analysis Module: Processes data from the tests, calculates average reaction times, and generates charts illustrating the user's progress in each series of tests.
